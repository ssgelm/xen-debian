Subject: tools/tests/x86_emulator: Pass -no-pie -fno-pic to gcc on x86_32

The current build fails with GCC6 on Debian sid i386 (unstable):

 /tmp/ccqjaueF.s: Assembler messages:
 /tmp/ccqjaueF.s:3713: Error: missing or invalid displacement expression `vmovd_to_reg_len@GOT'

This is due to the combination of GCC6, and Debian's decision to
enable some hardening flags by default (to try to make runtime
addresses less predictable):
  https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening/PIEByDefaultTransition

This is of no benefit for the x86 instruction emulator test, which is
a rebuild of the emulator code for testing purposes only.  So pass
options to disable this.

These options will be no-ops if they are the same as the compiler
default.

On amd64, the -fno-pic breaks the build in a different way.  So do
this only on i386.
